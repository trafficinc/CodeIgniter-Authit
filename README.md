CodeIgniter Authit
==================

A lightweight and flexible CodeIgniter 3 authentication library. It comes packaged with an example `Auth` class and related views so that you can get your CI project up and running in minutes. Test/View, sent emails with an email preview that allows you to view the last sent email by going to ...auth/sentemails. See config/authit to turn on for development, off for production, and on each authentication action you want it on, already enabled on password reset functionality by default.  

Requirements
------------

* CodeIgniter 3.0+
* PHP 5.5+
* MySQL

Installation
------------

1. Download and unpack the contents of the application folder to your CodeIgniter project.
2. That's it! Visit `/auth` to signup and login.
3. If you want you can edit `application/config/authit.php` to change some settings, but the defaults are fine.

Usage
-----

See [example Auth controller](application/controllers/Auth.php) which provides a functioning example of login, sign up, logout and forget/reset password. The Authit library provides several API methods:

`logged_in()` - Returns `true` if the current user logged in, `false` otherwise.

`login($email, $password)` - Attempts to login a user with a given `$email` and `$password`. Returns `true` if successful and `false` otherwise.

`logout([$redirect = false])` - Logs out the current user (by destroying the session). Accepts an optional `$redirect` parameter to redirect to a given URI after logout.

`signup($email, $password)` - Attempts to create a user with a given `$email` and `$password`. Returns `true` if successful and `false` otherwise.

`reset_password($user_id, $new_password)` - Resets the password of the user with the given `$user_id`.

The [Authit helper](application/helpers/authit_helper.php) includes the following helper functions:

`logged_in()` - Returns `true` if the current user logged in, `false` otherwise (shortcut to the Authit library `logged_in()` function).

`user([$key = ''])` - Returns the session data for the currently logged in user. If you specifiy a `$key` you can get specific info, for exmaple `user('id')` returns the currently logged in user ID.
